With dozens of ssh connections each days, you better need a shortcut way to make it faster. Frustation comes to a end with this script:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/24556.js"></script>

Put this _ruby script_ in your bin directory, make it executable, *add your servers info hash* in the array, and eventually "copy your ssh public key in the various servers to never be asked for password":http://pkeck.myweb.uga.edu/ssh/.

When executing it, you can give it the '_id_' as an argument, and it will connect automatically to the server with the corresponding id!
