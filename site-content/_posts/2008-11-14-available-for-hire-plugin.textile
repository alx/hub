It was when reading "Dr Nic blog":http://drnicwilliams.com/ that I noticed the big banner at the bottom announcing his availability for hire.

So, after a few moment in my source editor, this banner is now available as a Wordpress plugin, with few options inside Wordpress admin to select the specialities you want to be hire for :)
