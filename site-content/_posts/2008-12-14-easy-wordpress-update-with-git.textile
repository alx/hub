title: Easy Wordpress upgrade with Git
---

Wordpress has released its new version 2.7 few days ago, and since all my blogs are now controlled with Git behind, here is the way to do it quickly and easyly.

You might take care not to have modified anything in the Wordpress Core files (like _wp-includes_) or in _/wp-content/themes/default_ as these changes will be crushed during the copy.

* "Download Wordpress":http://wordpress.org/latest.zip
* Uncompress the archive on your computer, e.g. ~/Download/wordpress/
* Copy the files from the new Wordpress to your local git clone: _cp -r ~/Download/wordpress/* ~/my-blog-clone/_

The git part:

* Add the new files in your local git clone: _git add ._
* Commit the upgrade locally: _git commit -a -m "upgrade to new wordpress"_
* Push the changes to your git server: _git push_

Now, connect to your blog server, by ssh:

* _ssh username@your-blog-hosting.com_
* Move to your blog folder in your server, it should already be a git clone: _cd my-blog-clone_
* Retrieve the changes from the git server: _git pull_

You just have to upgrade your blog database now, going to: _http://your-blog.com/wp-admin/upgrade.php_
