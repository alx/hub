First, Nginx is not like Apache or Lighttpd, it doesn't support FastCGI by default. So, you need to be sure you've compiled the fcgi module with your PHP installation.

On Centos, to compile a new PHP, just launch: *_/scripts/easyapache_*

Then you'll need to launch the FastCGI process, "download this FastCGI script":http://blog.alexgirard.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/fastcgi_script.txt, place it in /usr/local/bin, and "add it to your init.d":http://www.zabbix.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3280.

At the end, you just need to configure your php server in nginx, that would be the most simple part:
